# IMP-Logics-demo

This project holds a simple demo program to show the main capabilities of the IMP-Logics tool
(https://github.com/inLabFIB/imp-logics),a java metamodel of Datalog and its extension to Datalog+/-.

In particular, the *MainDemo* class shows:
1. The capabilities of IMP-Logics for manipulating a Datalog schema. That is, parsing, printing, and basic operations over the Datalog metamodel.
2. The capabilities of IMP-Logics for manipulating a Dependency schema (Datalog+/-). That is, parsing, printing, and basic operations over the Dependency metamodel.
3. How to use the previous to implement, for instance, an OBDA query-rewriting algorithm.
